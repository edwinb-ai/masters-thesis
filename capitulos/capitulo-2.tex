\chapter{Liquid State Theory}
\label{Cap2}

In this chapter, a complete description of Liquid State
Theory is carried out. In particular, the focus of the chapter is
to state what a liquid is, its thermodynamical properties and
how equilibrium statistical mechanics is used to understand them.
Then, a description of the theory of integral equations is presented,
and from this the Ornstein-Zernike formalism is derived.
The chapter is closed with a brief description of computer simulation
methods, and in particular, of the Monte Carlo computer simulation
method. Monte Carlo simulations are numerical schemes that make it
possible to study liquids based on first-principles, from which
a baseline result is obtained.
