\chapter{Liquid State Theory}
\label{Cap2}

In this chapter, a brief description of Liquid State Theory is carried out. In particular, 
the focus of the chapter is to state what a liquid is, its thermodynamical properties and
how equilibrium statistical mechanics is used to understand them. Then, a description of 
The hard-sphere fluid is mentioned, which is the fundamental system studied in this work.
Then, the theory of integral equations is presented, and from this the Ornstein-Zernike 
formalism is derived. The chapter is closed with a brief description of computer simulation
methods, and in particular, of the Monte Carlo computer simulation method. Monte Carlo 
simulations are numerical schemes that make it possible to study liquids based on 
first-principles, attempting to approximate the underlying probability distribution of
the system, and with this, to obtain all the physical properties of the fluid.
